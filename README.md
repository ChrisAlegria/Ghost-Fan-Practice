# 👻 Ghost Website Practice

## 📖 Project Description  
This repository contains a **personal practice project** created to reinforce and explore the use of **HTML** and **CSS** by recreating the official website of the band **Ghost**. The goal was to apply previously acquired knowledge through a hands-on approach, focusing on structure, layout, and styling while experimenting with custom elements and adjustments.

The design of this project closely follows the layout and aesthetic of the band's original site, with some personal tweaks and improvements made to adapt it to a personal learning context.

> ⚠️ Please note that this is not a commercial or official project. It is a **personal and educational practice** intended to improve front-end development skills through code experimentation.

## ⚖️ Use of Non-Owned Content  
This project originally included **multimedia resources** (such as images, fonts, icons, and other assets) from the official Ghost website and related sources. However, **those assets are not included** in this repository due to copyright considerations.

All files were deliberately excluded to **respect the intellectual property** of their respective owners. The repository only contains the HTML and CSS structure, allowing the project to be viewed and analyzed from a coding perspective without distributing third-party material.

### ⚠️ Important  
- The **code** in this repository is **entirely my own work**.  
- The original multimedia assets (images, fonts, icons, etc.) belong to their respective creators and companies and are not distributed here.  
- This project is for **educational purposes only** and does not intend to infringe on the rights of the original content owners.  
- Some layout or visual elements may currently appear broken or incomplete due to the absence of original assets. Future updates will aim to make the site look functional without needing those files.
